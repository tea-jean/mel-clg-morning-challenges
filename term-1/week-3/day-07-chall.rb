# Day 7 Morning Challenges
############################

# Challenge 1

# Ask the user to enter a 24 hour based time as a float (so 5:38pm would be 17.38). If the user enters a number that is less than 12 print "Morning"; if the number entered is exactly 12, print "Midday"; if number is greater than 12 but less than or equal to 13 print "Lunch"; if the number is greater than 13, but less than 17, print "Afternoon"; if the number entered is less than or equal to 21 but more than or equal to 17 print "Evening"; if number is greater than 21 but less than or equal to 24 print "Time for bed". If they enter 0 or 24, print "Midnight". If the time isn't in the 24 hour range print "Not a valid 24 hour time".

# You can add in more responses if you like.

user_time = gets.to_f
puts "You have entered #{user_time}"
